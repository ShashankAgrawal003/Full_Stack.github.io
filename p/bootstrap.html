        <strong>Bootstrap</strong> is a free and open-source framework for creating websites and web applications. 
        It's the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first 
        projects on the web.
        As the web evolves more and more toward <u>responsive design</u>, it can be a real challenge for 
        web developers to keep up. Bootstrap can make things a whole lot easier. 
        Bootstrap enables you to create responsive websites without you needing to do the "responsive" bit. 
        Bootstrap takes care of that.Bootstrap is promoted as being One framework, every device. 
        This is because websites built with Bootstrap will <u>automatically scale between devices</u> â€” whether the 
        device is a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, screen reader, etc.
