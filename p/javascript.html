        <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a very powerful client-side scripting language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing 
        the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and 
        interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in Game development and 
        Mobile application development.JavaScript was developed by <strong><u>Brendan Eich</u></strong> in 1995, which appeared in 
        Netscape, a popular browser of that time.The language was initially called LiveScript and was later 
        renamed JavaScript.
